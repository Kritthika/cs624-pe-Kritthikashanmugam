# Input:

The primary input for this React Native application involves user interactions for managing information related to cities and countries. 
Users input data through various forms, such as adding cities, locations within those cities, and countries with their corresponding 
currencies and values. The application captures details like city names, location information, country names, currencies,
and additional values provided by the users.

# Process:

The application's core logic revolves around React Navigation, which facilitates tab-based navigation and stack-driven 
navigation within each tab. For cities, users can view a list of cities, navigate to individual city screens, and 
add new cities through the "Add City" tab. Locations can be added within a city, updating the city's location array. 
Similarly, for countries, users can navigate to the "Countries" tab, view a list of countries, navigate to individual country screens,
and add new countries through the "Add Country" tab. Values can be added for a country, updating the country's values array.

# Output:

The output of this React Native application is a dynamic user interface that allows users to effectively manage information about cities 
and countries. The output is organized into tabs, providing a structured display of information. The "Cities" tab shows a list of cities,
each linking to its individual screen with details and added locations. The "Countries" tab displays a list of countries, each linking to
its individual screen with details and added values. The output provides a clear and organized representation of the input data, 
facilitating user interaction and data management.
