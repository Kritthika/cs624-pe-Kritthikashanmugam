# INPUT
The existing React Native project, "CitiesApp," serves as the input foundation.
User inputs, specifically Country Name and Currency, are collected through the "AddCountry" tab.
The app's internal data, including the list of countries and their currencies, serves as input.
# PROCESS
Two new tabs, namely "AddCountry" and "Countries," are introduced within the project using a navigation library, 
expanding the application's functionality.Code modifications within the "AddCountry" tab enable the capturing of user inputs 
for Country Name and Currency. Validation checks ensure completeness.
Code adjustments in the "Countries" tab enable the rendering of a list displaying countries along with their respective currencies.
# OUTPUT
The output is an extended app with additional tabs, broadening the user interface and navigation options.
The "AddCountry" tab is enhanced to receive and process user inputs, facilitating the addition of countries with associated currencies.
The "Countries" tab now effectively showcases a comprehensive list of countries and currencies, enhancing the user's informational experience within the app.
